Directions
----------

> Total time: 6-30 hours

1. Dry with paper towels. [Remove silverskin](http://www.finecooking.com/article/how-to-remove-silverskin-from-ribs). Lightly apply slather. Season pretty heavily with kosher salt. Generously apply rub (as much as will stick). Wrap with foil and refridgerate 2-24 hours.

1. Allow the meat to warm up at room temperature (~30 minutes) while the smoker comes to temperature.

1. Setup water pan. Cook meat side up until the desired final color is reached (~2-3 hours), spritzing occassionally, and refilling water pan as necessary, to maintain moisture.

1. Spritz one last time, brush both sides with barbecue sauce, and tightly wrap in alluminum foil (which has also been spritzed) meat side down. Optionally, transfer to an oven, because there's no reason to consume additional wood or smoke.

1. Cook to 195-200 F and tender (~1-2 hours).

1. Rest to 160 F (~30 minutes).
