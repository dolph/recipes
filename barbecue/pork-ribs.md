# Ribs

Dry with paper towels, remove membrane, back flap, and round corners:

- 2 racks **St. Louis style pork ribs**

Slather:

- **Yellow mustard**

Mix together, and generously apply rub (as much as will stick):

- 1/4 cup **brown sugar**
- 2 tablespoon **paprika**
- 1 tablespoon **garlic powder**
- 1 tablespoon **onion powder**
- 1 teaspoon **black pepper**
- 1 teaspoon **cayenne** (optional)

Place on a rack, uncovered, and refridgerate 1-24 hours.

Remove ribs from the fridge, and let rest 1-2 hours. Meanwhile, setup a water pan and bring smoker to **250 F** using:

- 4 parts **hickory wood**
- 1 part **cherry wood**
- 1 part **apple wood**

Cook meat side up, spritzing occassionally, and refilling water pan as necessary, to maintain moisture. Turn 180 degrees to allow the second side to face heat after 2-3 hours. Cook to 195-205 F and tender (~3-5 hours total).

Spritz one last time, brush meat side with barbecue sauce, and tightly wrap in foil, meat side down, to rest.

Rest to 150 F (~30-45 minutes).
