# Smoked turkey legs

> A basic wet brine for cured turkey legs uses roughly 5% kosher salt, 10% brown sugar, and 0.25% pink curing salt (Prague powder #1) by total weight of the meat and brine combined.

In a pot, bring to a gentle simmer until the solids are dissolved:

- 1000 milliliters **water**
- 200 grams **kosher salt**
- 400 grams **brown sugar**
- 12 grams **pink curing salt #1** (Prague Powder #1, 6.25%)
- Fresh **poultry herbs** (thyme, sage, rosemary, bay leaves)
- 2 teaspoons **black peppercorns**
- 6 **garlic cloves**, smashed

Transfer to a food-safe storage container, and ensure the liquid is below 40 F:

- Brine
- 3000 grams **ice** / **cold water**

Once the liquid is below 40 F, fully submerge (weigh down if necessary):

- 9 *turkey legs**

Refrigerate overnight.

Remove the turkey legs from the brine and rinse them thoroughly. Pat dry. Place onto a wire rack on a sheet pan. Allow to air dry in the fridge for 1-4 hours.

Preheat smoker to 265-275 F.

Smoke until internal temp reaches 180 F (about 2-3.5 hours).

Rest about 20 minutes while the smoker comes up to 450 F.

Roast for 5-8 minutes until skin is lightly crisped.
