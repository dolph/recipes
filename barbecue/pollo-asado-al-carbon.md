# Pollo asado al carb√≥n

This translates directly to "charcoal grilled chicken." The charcoal is a core component in the flavor, and it's therefore imperative that you grill it over charcoal.

## Grilling

Prepare a grill with a hot side and a cool side. Bring the grill to 325 F degrees. Brush the grill grates with oil.

Cook chicken bone-side down on the cool side of the grill, legs facing the hot side, covered, until the breast reaches an internal temperature of 155 F.

Turn the chicken skin-side down on the hot side of the grill for 1-3 minutes, until crisped (watch carefully to avoid burning).

Rest 5-10 minutes.
