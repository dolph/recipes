Brisket

> It's not possible to write a traditional "recipe" for brisket. Instead, we have some of the variables.

Build a 200 F fire.

Trim:

- High choice or prime **brisket**

Set aside trimmings in a foil pan.

Slather:

- **Olive oil**

Rub:

- 1 part **kosher salt**
- 1 part **black pepper**

When the smoker has stabilized at 200 F with slightly dirty smoke, add the brisket, fat side up, along with the pan of trimmings.

Smoke for 3-4 hours, maintaining slightly dirty smoke.

Raise the smoker temperature to 225 F. Add wood and small bits of brisket trimmings directly to the fire as needed to maintain smoke.

When the fat feels like jello to the touch, and the brisket has noticeably shrunk, the internal temperature will likely be around 175-180 F. Wrap in butcher paper, and return to the smoker. Raise the smoker temperature to 275 F and maintain clean smoke.

Cook to a final internal temperature of 203 F.

Rest in a cooler for 2-12 hours to 140 F.
