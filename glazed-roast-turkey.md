## Dry brine

Separate turkey into leg quarters, wings, breasts (do not separate), and backbone.

- 12–14 pound **turkey**, parted

Combine in a medium bowl:

- 2 tablespoons whole **black peppercorns**, very finely ground
- 2 tablespoons whole **pink peppercorns**, very finely ground
- 4.5 tablespoons **kosher salt**
- 2 tablespoons **garlic powder**
- 2 tablespoons **onion powder**
- 1 tablespoon **smoked paprika**
- 1 tablespoon **light brown sugar**

Place turkey on a wire rack set in a baking sheet triple lined with aluminum foil, apply dry brine mixture, and refrigerate for 24-48 hours.

## Glaze

Cook in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and glaze thickens slightly (it should just barely coat a spoon, about 10–12 minutes).

- Small handful of hardy herbs (such as sage, rosemary, bay leaves, and/or thyme)
- 4 cloves **garlic**, crushed
- 2 2x1" strips **orange** zest
- 1/3 cup **soy sauce**
- 1/3 cup **red wine vinegar**
- 1/3 cup **brown sugar**

Remove glaze from heat.

## Roast

Rest turkey at room temperature for 2 hours.

Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425 F.

Rub turkey:

- 6 tablespoons **canola oil**

Pour into baking sheet:

- 1 cup **water**

Roast turkey, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until skin is mostly golden brown (about 20–25 minutes).

Reduce oven temperature to 300 F and continue to roast turkey, brushing with glaze every 20 minutes and adding more water as needed to maintain liquid in baking sheet, until the breast registers 150 F, and the thighs register 170 F, 50–70 minutes longer.

Tent with foil and rest 30-60 minutes before carving.
