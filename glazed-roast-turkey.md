## Turkey

Separate turkey into leg quarters, wings, breasts (do not separate), and backbone.

- 12–14 pound **turkey**, neck and giblets removed

## Dry brine

Very finely grind black and pink peppercorns in a spice mill and transfer to a medium bowl.

- 2 tablespoons whole **black peppercorns**
- 2 tablespoons whole **pink peppercorns**

 Add salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and brown sugar and mix together.

- 1/4 cup plus 1.5 teaspoons **kosher salt**
- 2 tablespoons **garlic powder**
- 2 tablespoons **onion powder**
- 1 tablespoon **smoked paprika**
- 1 tablespoon **light brown sugar**

Place turkey on a wire rack set in a baking sheet, apply dry brine mixture, and refrigerate for 24-48 hours.

Remove turkey from wire rack and rinse baking sheet and rack if needed (turkey will most likely release some liquid). Line baking sheet with 3 layers of foil to make cleanup easy and set rack back inside. Arrange turkey pieces on rack, skin side up, and let sit at room temperature 2–3 hours to help decrease the cooking time.

## Glaze

Cook herbs, garlic, orange zest, soy sauce, vinegar, and remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and glaze thickens slightly (it should just barely coat a spoon), 10–12 minutes. Remove glaze from heat.

- Small handful of hardy herbs (such as sage, rosemary, bay leaves, and/or thyme)
- 4 cloves **garlic**, crushed
- 2 2x1" strips **orange** zest
- 1/3 cup **soy sauce**
- 1/3 cup **red wine vinegar**
- 1/3 cup **brown sugar**
- 6 tablespoons **canola oil**

## Roasting

Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425°. Rub turkey with oil and pour 1 cup water into baking sheet. Roast turkey, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until skin is mostly golden brown, 20–25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300° and continue to roast turkey, brushing with glaze every 20 minutes and adding more water by ½-cupfuls as needed to maintain some liquid in baking sheet, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 150°, and 170° when inserted into the thickest part of the thighs, 50–70 minutes longer (total cooking time will be 1–1½ hours). Skin should be deep golden brown and shiny. Transfer turkey to a cutting board; tent loosely with foil. Let rest 30–60 minutes before carving.
