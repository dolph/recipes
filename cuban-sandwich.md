Pork shoulder
-------------

> Can be made ahead and refridgerated.

Brine 12-24 hours:

- 6 pound pork shoulder, tied
- 4 cups fresh orange juice
- 1/2 cup rice vinegar
- 1/2 cup spiced rum
- 1/2 cup salt
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 10 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary
- 1 tablespoon fresh oregano
- 1 tablespoon fresh sage
- 1 tablespoon peppercorns
- 3 bay leaves
- Enough water to cover

Remove pork from brine and pat dry.

Marinate 2-8 hours:

- Brined pork shoulder
- 2/3 cups olive oil
- 2/3 cups cilantro
- 4 tablespoons mint leaves
- 1/2 cups orange juice
- 1/2 cups fresh squeezed lime juice
- 7 garlic cloves, minced
- 1.5 tablespoons grated orange peel
- 2 teaspoons fresh oregano, chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 2/3 teaspoons black pepper, ground
- 2/3 teaspoons fine sea salt

> Final temperature seems far too low. 190-195 F would still be sliceable, but would make it past the stall.

On a sheet pan fitted with a wire rack, roast at 275 F until the internal temp hits 170 F. Periodically baste pork with marinade throughout roasting.

- Pork shoulder

Rest to 140 F.

Refridgerate if time allows.
