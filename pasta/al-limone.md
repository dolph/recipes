# Al limone

Whisk together egg slurry in a small bowl and side aside:

- 1 **egg**
- 1 **egg yolk**
- 1 tablespoon **creme fraiche** (or **heavy cream**)
- 3 ounces **parmesan cheese**, grated

In a stock pot, cook in heavily salted water until 2 minutes short of al dente (or just enough to heat fresh pasta through):

- 200 grams dried **pasta** (e.g. linguine)

Meanwhile, mix to combine in a high-walled saute pan, and begin heating over very low heat:

- 3 tablespoons **olive oil**
- 1 clove **garlic**, thinly sliced
- Zest of 1 **lemon**
- Black pepper

Add pasta to saute pan and toss together:

- **Parsley**, chopped
- Juice of 1/2 **lemon**

Add, and adjust until the desired texture is reached:

- 1/4 cup boiling pasta water, plus more, to texture
- Most of the egg slurry, to texture
- Kosher salt, to taste

Garnish:

- **Parmesan cheese**, finely grated
- Black pepper
