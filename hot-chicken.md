Season
------

Season, cover, and chill 3-24 hours:

- 3.5–4 pound **chicken**, cut into 10 pieces (breasts halved)
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Kosher salt

Buttermilk mixture
------------------

Whisk together in a large bowl:

- 2 **eggs**
- 1 cups **buttermilk** (or **whole milk**)
- 2 tablespoons vinegar-based **hot sauce**

Flour mixture
-------------

In a second large bowl, whisk together:

- 2 cups **flour**
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt

Spice mixture
-------------

Whisk together in a medium bowl:

- 3 tablespoons **cayenne pepper**
- 1.5 tablespoons **dark brown sugar**
- 1/2 teaspoon **chili powder**
- 1/2 teaspoon **garlic powder**
- 1/2 teaspoon **paprika**

Frying
------

Preheat a dutch oven to 325 F:

- 2 inches **peanut oil** (~5 cups)

Pat chicken dry.

Working with 1 piece at a time:

1. Dredge in flour mixture
2. Shake off excess
3. Dip in buttermilk mixture (let excess drip back into bowl)
4. Dredge in flour mixture
5. Place on a baking sheet

Working in two batches and returning oil to 325° between batches, fry chicken, turning occasionally, until skin is deep golden brown and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of pieces registers 160° for white meat and 165° for dark, 15–18 minutes.

Transfer to a clean wire rack set inside a baking sheet. Let oil cool slightly.

Whisk together:

- Spice mixture
- 1/2 cup frying oil

Brush fried chicken with spicy oil.

Serve with:

- **White bread**
- **Dill pickles**
