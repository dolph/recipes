Carne guisada
=============

> Total time: 5 hours

Season beef with salt & pepper:

- 3 pounds **beef chuck**
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

In a stock pot over high heat, brown on all sides:

- Beef
- 1 tablespoon canola oil

Remove the beef and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes. When rested, remove the layer of fat, and then cut into 3/4" cubes.

Meanwhile, make a medium roux:

- 1/2 cup flour
- 6 tablespoons butter

Saute until softened:

- 3 **poblanos**, seeded and chopped
- 1 large **onion**, chopped
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt

Saute until fragrant:

- 9 cloves **garlic**, minced

Add, and heat through:

- 8 **Roma tomatoes**, chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh **oregano** (or 2 teaspoons dried mexican oregano)
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 3 bay leaves

Add, and bring everything to a boil:

- Cubed beef
- 1 quart beef stock, plus an additional 1/2 quart set aside

Reduce over low heat, simmering very gently until thickened (~3-4 hours) and beef is tender. Skim fat from surface and stir every 15-20 minutes. If necessary, add additional stock (or water) to prevent the gravy from thickening until the beef is tender.

Season to taste:

- Kosher salt

Remove bay leaves.

Serve with:

- 2 dozen **Flour tortillas**
- 1 pound **Sharp cheddar**
