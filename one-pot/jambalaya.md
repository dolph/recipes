Shrimp & shrimp stock
---------------------

Peel, devein, and season shrimp, reserving shrimp shells in a 3 quart pot.

- 1.5 pounds large **shrimp** (10-25 per pound), peeled and deveined, shells reserved
- Kosher salt
- Cajun seasoning

Keep shrimp refridgerated.

Bring to a simmer, and reduce for at least 20 minutes:

- Shrimp shells
- Water, to cover

Strain shrimp stock from shrimp shells and set aside.

Composition
-----------

Start, skin-side down, in a cold dutch oven:

- 4 bone-in, skin-on **chicken thighs**, trimmed
- Kosher salt

Bring to medium heat until well browned on each side, flipping once when chicken skin releases from the bottom.

Transfer the chicken to a small bowl, and discard skin (no need to keep warm).

Brown:

- 1.5 pounds **Andouille sausage**, halved lengthwise, cut into 1/4 inch pieces

Transfer the sausage to a small bowl, and set aside (no need to keep warm).

Cook until the onion is softened:

- 1 **onion**, chopped medium
- 1 **red bell pepper**, stemmed, seeded, chopped medium
- 5 cloves **garlic**, pressed
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

Optionally, add, and cook out any remaining liquid:

- 14.5 ounce can **diced tomatoes**, drained

Season with:

- 2 teaspoons **paprika**
- 2 teaspoons **garlic powder**
- 2 teaspoon freshly ground **black pepper**
- 1 teaspoon **cayenne pepper**
- 1 teaspoon **onion powder**
- 1 teaspoon **dried oregano**
- 1 teaspoon **dried thyme**

Add the rice and cook until translucent:

- 2 cups long grain **white rice**, rinsed

Add the liquids, and bring to a gentle simmer, and leave uncovered.

- 3.5 cups liquid (use a combination of shrimp stock, bottled **clam juice**, and chicken broth)

Return the chicken to the pot, nestling it into the water. Cook until the chicken is cooked through (about 30 minutes).

- Partially-cooked chicken

Transfer chicken to a plate, and keep warm. Shred into bite size pieces when convenient.

If the rice is not yet cooked through, cover and hold over low heat.

Stir the shrimp and sausage into the rice, cover, and cook over low heat until cooked through (~3-10 minutes).

- Seasoned shrimp
- Sausage

Remove the skillet from the heat and let stand until the shrimp are fully cooked and the rice is tender.

- 1/4 cup freshly chopped **parsley**
- Shredded chicken
- Kosher salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Serve with:

- Louisiana-style **hot sauce**
