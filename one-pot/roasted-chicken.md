Skillet roasted chicken
=======================

> Crispy skin, and intense citrus and herb flavors. Recipe scales well with equipment.

Preheat oven to 450 F, and place a skillet in the oven.

> The chicken needs to be salted heavier than normal in order to stand up to
  the acid introduced later.

Season:

- 2 **chicken quarters**, bone-in, skin-on, trimmed
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

When the oven is preheated, reduce the oven to 400 F, transfer the skillet to
the stove over medium-high heat, and sear, skin-side down, until the skins are
browned:

- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- Chicken pieces

Flip chicken over, and transfer skillet to oven. Bake until chicken is cooked.

> Now is a good time to add hearty, seasoned vegetables to roast with the
  chicken, such as Brussels sprouts, fennel, carrots, potatoes, asparagus, pearl
  onions, garlic, shallots, etc.

When the chicken is done, transfer the skillet back to the stove, set the
chicken aside to rest, and discard all but 1 tablespoon of the remaining fat in
the pan. Add:

- 1 tablespoon **butter**
- 1 large **garlic** clove, minced
- 1 teaspoon fresh **thyme**, minced

When the garlic begins to brown, add:

- 2 tablespoons **lemon** juice
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- Black pepper

Pour the pan sauce over the chicken and serve immediately.

Serve with:

- **White rice**, cooked in **chicken stock** with **bay leaves**
