Chimichurri
===========

> Makes 1 cup.

Combine in a food processor, and pulse until finely minced:

- 26 grams (~2/3 cup) fresh parsley leaves
- 13 grams (~1/3 cup) fresh cilantro leaves
- 85 grams red onion
- 1 pickled Spanish Piquillo pepper
- 20 grams fresh garlic

> Including the oil too early causes it to emulsify.

In a small bowl, combine with the liquids, season, and mix thoroughly:

- 110 grams (1/2 cup) extra virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice or red wine vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

> Maybe needs more oil and more salt.
