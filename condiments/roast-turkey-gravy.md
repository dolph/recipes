## Beurre manié

Mash together in a small bowl with your fingers or a fork until homogenous:

- 6 tablespoons **flour**
- 4 tablespoons **butter**, room temperature

Set aside.

## Roast

Preheat oven to 450 F.

Toss wings in a large cast-iron skillet with oil until coated.

- 3 pounds **turkey and/or chicken wings**, flats and drumettes separated
- 2 tablespoons **olive oil**

Roast, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and starting to crisp (about 25–35 minutes).

Remove wings from oven and add, tossing to coat with oil:

- 2 heads of **garlic**, cut in half crosswise
- 2 large **shallots**, unpeeled, halved
- 1 4" piece **ginger**, scrubbed, thickly sliced
- 4 ounces **crimini, shiitake, or white button mushrooms**, torn into large pieces
- 2 teaspoons **black peppercorns**, lightly crushed
- 2 tablespoons **olive oil**

Return to oven and roast, tossing halfway through, until wings are deeply browned and crisp and vegetables are browned (about 30–40 minutes).

Remove skillet from oven and set on stovetop over medium-high heat. Add sherry and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until sherry is almost completely reduced (about 2 minutes).

- 1/2 cup **amontillado sherry**

## Gravy

Transfer everything to a medium pot, add stock and parsley, and bring to a low simmer over medium-high heat:

- Roasted wings and aromatics
- 6 cups **turkey stock**, warmed
- **Parsley**

Reduce heat and simmer gently, skimming fat from surface occasionally and turning wings so both sides get a chance to be submerged, until liquid is flavorful, mahogany in color, and reduced by about one-third (about 30–40 minutes).

Strain and discard solids, rinse pot, and return broth back to pot, and bring to a simmer.

Add and whisk constantly until completely incorporated:

- Beurre manié

Simmer, whisking often and skimming any foam from surface, until gravy is thick enough to coat a spoon (about 6–8 minutes).

> Hold here if making ahead.

Remove from heat and whisk in:

- 2 teaspoons **sherry vinegar** or **red wine vinegar**
- 1 teaspoons **MSG**

Season to taste:

- **Kosher salt**
- **Black pepper**

Drink with turkey and mashed potatoes.
