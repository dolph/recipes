# Chile oil

> Based on [Sohla's chile _crisp_](https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-spicy-chili-crisp) recipe

In a 2-quart heatproof bowl, combine:

- 30 grams **minced ginger**
- 30 grams **kosher salt**
- 20 grams **sugar**
- 12 grams **mushroom powder**
- 6 grams freshly ground **cumin**
- 4 grams **MSG**
- 2 grams freshly ground **black pepper**
- 2 red or black **cardamom pods**, split in half, wrapped in cheesecloth

Set aside.

Put on disposable latex gloves.

Using kitchen shears, remove stems and seeds from chiles inside a quarter-sheet tray:

- 80 grams **dried chiles** (preferably a mix)

Using a spice grinder and working in batches, process chiles until they are
ground to a size just larger than standard chile flakes. Transfer processed
chiles to the 2-quart heatproof bowl.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over another 2-quart heatproof bowl. In a 2-quart saucepan,
combine:

- 350 grams **peanut oil**, or any other neutral oil
- 200 grams **shallots**, thinly sliced

Cook over high heat while stirring constantly.

Once shallots become light golden brown, strain.

Pour oil back into pot and add:

- 65 grams **garlic**, thinly sliced

Cook over medium-low heat, constantly stirring, until light golden brown, then
strain. Return oil to pot once more.

Set aside fried shallots and garlic.

Heat oil to 375 F. _Slowly_ pour hot oil over chiles and spices.

Stir well to distribute hot oil throughout. Set aside to fully cool, about 30
minutes, or until bowl or pot is cool to the touch.

Remove cardamom pods. Mix in fried shallots and garlic. Whisk in:

- 30 grams **peanut butter**

Pour finished chili crisp into jars and store in the fridge for about 3 months.

It can be served immediately, but for best flavor, eat it the next day. Stir
well before serving.
