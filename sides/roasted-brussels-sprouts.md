# Roasted Brussels sprouts

Preheat oven to 425 F.

Toss together:

- 3/4 pounds **Brussels sprouts**, halved
- 2 tablespoons **olive oil**
- **Kosher salt**

In a 12" oven-safe skillet over medium-low heat, sear until well-browned:

- Seasoned Brussels sprouts, flat side down

Transfer skillet to oven until sprouts are consistently browned on top (about 15 minutes).

Meanwhile, whisk together in a bowl large enough to toss all of the Brussels sprouts:

- 2 tablespoons **parsley**, minced
- 1 teaspoon **piquin peppers**, minced
- 1 tablespoon salt-packed **capers**, rinsed and minced
- 2 tablespoons **white wine vinegar**
- 1 tablespoon **honey**

Toss together to coat. Season to taste.
