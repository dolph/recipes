## 5 pound version

### Roast

Preheat oven to 425 F. Place potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet or in a large baking dish and cover tightly with foil. Roast until very tender (about 80–95 minutes) and internal temperature reaches 210 F.

- 5 pounds **Yukon Gold potatoes**, scrubbed

### Garlic mixture

Meanwhile, place in a large saucepan:

- 350 grams (25 tablespoons) **butter**
- 1 head of **garlic**, halved crosswise
- 6 sprigs **thyme**
- 10 grams **black peppercorns**, lightly crushed
- 30 grams **kosher salt**
- 1050 grams (5 cups) **whole milk**
- Zest of 1 large **lemon** (in large strips)

Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Immediately remove from heat, cover, and let sit at least 30 minutes.

### Mashed potatoes

When potatoes are done, remove skins while they are very hot (hold with a kitchen towel), add to a 4-quart soup pot, and mash immediately.

Return garlic mixture to a simmer, then strain into pot with potatoes, discarding solids.

Set potato mixture over medium heat and whisk until liquid is incorporated and potatoes are very smooth and bubbling. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

Cover and refrigerate.

- Freshly ground **black pepper**

Cook, stirring, until mixture is coated in butter and fragrant, about 1 minute.

Meanwhile, combine in a small bowl:

- 4 sprigs **thyme**, leaves picked
- 1.25 teaspoon **hot smoked Spanish paprika**
- Zest of 1 large **lemon**, finely grated

Remove crumb mixture from oven and immediately toss in thyme mixture. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Let topping cool in pan.
