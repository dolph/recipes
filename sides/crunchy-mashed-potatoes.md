## Roast

Preheat oven to 400 F. Place potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet or in a large baking dish and cover tightly with foil. Roast until very tender (about 80–95 minutes).

- 4 pounds **Yukon Gold potatoes**, scrubbed

## Garlic mixture

Meanwhile, place in a medium saucepan:

- 1 head of **garlic**, halved crosswise
- 5 sprigs **thyme**
- 2 teaspoons **black peppercorns**, lightly crushed
- 2.5 sticks **butter**
- 1 tablespoon **kosher salt**
- 4 cups **whole milk**
- Zest of 1 **lemon** (in large strips)

Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Immediately remove from heat, cover, and let sit at least 30 minutes.

## Mashed potatoes

When potatoes are done, remove skins while they are very hot (hold with a kitchen towel), add to a pot, and mash immediately.

Return garlic mixture to a simmer, then strain into pot with potatoes, discarding solids.

Set potato mixture over medium heat and whisk until liquid is incorporated and potatoes are very smooth and bubbling. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

Cover and keep warm until ready to serve.

> Hold here up to 2 days. Transfer potatoes to an airtight container and let cool. Cover and chill. Reheat over medium, whisking constantly and loosening with more milk if needed.

## Topping

Pulse in a food processor until finely chopped (about 15 seconds):

- 4 cloves of **garlic**

Add and process in long pulses until coarse crumbs form (about 1 minute):

- 2 1/2"-thick slices **country-style bread**, torn into 1" pieces

Add to breadcrumb mixture, and pulse just once or twice to combine:

- 2 cups **kettle-style potato chips** (such as Cape Cod)

Heat in a large skillet over medium heat until foaming:

- 4 tablespoons **butter**

Add:

- Breadcrumb mixture
- **Kosher salt**
- Freshly ground **black pepper**

Cook, stirring, until mixture is coated in butter and fragrant, about 1 minute.

Transfer skillet to oven and bake, tossing every 5 minutes, until dark golden brown (about 15–20 minutes).

Meanwhile, combine in a small bowl:

- 3 sprigs **thyme**, leaves picked
- 1 tsp. **hot smoked Spanish paprika**
- Zest of 1 **lemon**, finely grated

Remove crumb mixture from oven and immediately toss in thyme mixture. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Let topping cool in pan.

> Hold here up to 2 days. Store airtight at room temperature.

Add:

- 1/3 cup chopped **parsley**

## Serving

Transfer mashed potatoes to a large bowl and sprinkle topping over.
