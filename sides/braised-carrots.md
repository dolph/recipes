# Braised carrots

Preheat the oven to 375 F.

In a large ovenproof skillet (with fitting lid) over medium low heat, melt:

- 2 tablespoons unsalted **butter**

Add and season:

- 2 pounds **carrots**, peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick on the diagonal
- 1/4 cup **brown sugar**
- 2 **garlic** cloves, thinly sliced
- 2 **thyme** sprigs
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

Cook, tossing frequently, until the carrots are tender but not browned (~10 minutes).

Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil and remove from the heat.

- 1 cup **chicken stock** (or enough to almost cover the carrots)

Cover the carrots with parchment paper and cover the skillet with a lid.

Braise the carrots in the oven until they are very tender (~30 minutes).

Discard the thyme sprigs and serve.
