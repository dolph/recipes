Feta smashed potatoes
=====================

In a 4-quart saucepan, cover with cold salted water:

- 1 pound **gold potatoes**, quartered

Bring to a boil then simmer until the tines of a fork slide easily into the potatoes (~20 minutes). Drain, leaving potatoes in the pan.

Remove the saucepan from the heat.

Add and smash together:

- 1/3 cup **heavy cream** (or half & half)
- 4 tablespoons **unsalted butter**
- 6 oz **feta cheese**, chopped or crumbled
- **10 chives**, minced

Season to taste:

- Kosher salt and black pepper
