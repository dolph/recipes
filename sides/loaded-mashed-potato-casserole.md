# Loaded mashed potato casserole

## Roasted garlic

Preheat oven to 425 F.

Remove papery outer skin from garlic bulb (do not separate cloves). Cut tops off garlic bulb, brush with oil, and wrap bulb in aluminum foil.

- 1 **garlic** bulb
- 1 tablespoons canola oil

Bake until softened (~30 minutes). Allow to cool.

## Bacon

Preheat oven to 425 F.

Line a 13"x18" rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and top with a sheet of parchment paper. Arrange bacon strips on tray, overlapping as little as possible. Top with a second sheet of parchment paper; place a second baking sheet on top.

- 20 oz dry cured peppered **bacon**

Bake bacon until crisp (~30 minutes). Remove trays from oven, carefully remove top tray using tongs and an oven mitt, transfer bacon to a paper towelâ€“lined plate to drain.

Reserve rendered bacon fat.

## Potatoes

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Set potatoes in a colander and rinse under cold water until water runs clear.

- 5 pounds **gold potatoes**, peeled, skins removed (optionally reserve for [bunny rabbit ears](sides/bunny-rabbit-ears.md)), and cubed

Transfer to a large saucepan and cover with water by at least 2 inches, and season. Bring water to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until a knife easily pierces potatoes with no resistance (~10 minutes).

- Cold water
- Kosher salt

Drain potatoes in colander, then rinse with hot running water for 30 seconds.

Spread potatoes in an even layer on rimmed baking sheets and transfer to oven until excess moisture has evaporated and surface of potatoes is dry (~6 minutes).

Transfer cooked potatoes to a large mixing bowl, and mash to combine until only very small lumps remain:

- 1 stick unsalted **butter**, cubed and slightly softened
- 1 cup **sour cream**

Fold with a rubber spatula until fully incorporated:

- 1 cup **heavy cream**

Season:

- Kosher salt

Transfer potatoes to a 9"x13" baking dish with a smooth surface. Cover and hold.

## Casserole

Two hours before serving, remove potatoes from refrigerator and rest to room temp for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 F.

In a large mixing bowl, combine:

- 1.5 cups **panko bread crumbs**
- 8 oz **mild cheddar**, grated
- Rendered **bacon fat**, melted
- 1/4 cup **scallions**, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced
- **Chives**, minced
- Kosher salt

Spread bread crumb topping on potatoes.

Bake casserole until topping is browned and potatoes are heated through (160 F internal, ~45 minutes), and serve.
