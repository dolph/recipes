# Green bean casserole

Set oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350 F.

## Shallots

Add shallots to a nonstick saucepan, adding oil until almost covered. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until shallots are completely soft and light golden brown, about 12-20 minutes.

- 1 pound **shallots**, sliced 1/8 inch thick
- 2 cups **canola oil** (as needed)

Strain shallots through a fine-mesh strainer set in a heat-proof bowl.

Transfer shallots to baking sheet lined with 6 layers of paper towels. Transfer shallots from one layer to the next, using the previous layer to blot excess oil, until only one paper towel remains. Season well.

- **Kosher salt**

Allow shallots to cool completely, about 45 minutes, and transfer to an airtight container. Hold for up to 1 month.

## Green beans

Fill a large bowl with ice water:

- 1 quart **ice cubes**
- 2 quarts **water**

In a large pot (preferrably with a colander insert), bring to a boil over high heat:

- 1 gallon **water**
- 1/4 cup **kosher salt**

Add and boil until tender but still bright green, about 5 minutes:

- 2 pounds **green beans**, ends trimmed, cut into 2-inch segments

Drain through a colander and transfer to ice water until completely cooled. Drain green beans and set aside.
