Potato salad
============

Fancy version
-------------

Place the potatoes and salt in a large pot of water. Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes are barely tender when pierced with a knife.

- 1 pound small white potatoes
- 2 teaspoons Kosher salt

Drain the potatoes in a colander, then place the colander with the potatoes over the empty pot and cover with a clean, dry kitchen towel. Allow the potatoes to steam for 15 to 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine:

- 70 grams (~1/3 cup) mayonnaise
- 15 grams (~1 tablespoon) buttermilk
- 1 rib celery, chopped
- 3 tablespoons red onion, chopped
- 2 grams (3 tablespoons) fresh dill, chopped (or 2 tablespoons dill pickles, chopped)
- 2 teaspoons Colman's mustard powder
- 2 grams (~1 teaspoon) freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon Kosher salt

When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them down to bite size and add them to the bowl. Toss well, cover, and refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend.
