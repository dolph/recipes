Potato salad
============

Fancy version
-------------

Place the potatoes and salt in a large pot of water. Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes are barely tender when pierced with a knife.

- 1 pound small **white potatoes**
- 2 teaspoons **kosher salt**

Drain the potatoes in a colander, then place the colander with the potatoes over the empty pot and cover with a clean, dry kitchen towel. Allow the potatoes to steam for 15 to 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine:

- 70 grams (~1/3 cup) **mayonnaise**
- 15 grams (~1 tablespoon) **buttermilk**
- 1 rib **celery**, chopped
- 3 tablespoons **red onion**, chopped
- 2 grams (3 tablespoons) **dill**, chopped (or 2 tablespoons **dill pickles**, chopped)
- 2 teaspoons **Colman's mustard powder**
- 2 grams (~1 teaspoon) **black pepper**
- 1 teaspoon **Kosher salt**

When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them down to bite size and add them to the bowl. Toss well, cover, and refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend.
