## Wednesday

### Beurre manié

Mash together in a small bowl with your fingers or a fork until homogenous:

- 6 tablespoons **flour**
- 4 tablespoons **butter**, room temperature

Set aside.

### Roast gravy parts

Preheat oven to 450 F.

Toss wings in a large cast-iron skillet with oil until coated.

- 3 pounds **turkey and/or chicken wings**, flats and drumettes separated
- 2 tablespoons **olive oil**

Roast, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and starting to crisp (about 25–35 minutes).

Remove wings from oven and add, tossing to coat with oil:

- 2 heads of **garlic**, cut in half crosswise
- 2 large **shallots**, unpeeled, halved
- 1 4" piece **ginger**, scrubbed, thickly sliced
- 4 ounces **crimini, shiitake, or white button mushrooms**, torn into large pieces
- 2 teaspoons **black peppercorns**, lightly crushed
- 2 tablespoons **olive oil**

Return to oven and roast, tossing halfway through, until wings are deeply browned and crisp and vegetables are browned (about 30–40 minutes).

Remove skillet from oven and set on stovetop over medium-high heat. Add sherry and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until sherry is almost completely reduced (about 2 minutes).

- 1/2 cup **amontillado sherry**

### Gravy

Transfer everything to a medium pot, add stock and parsley, and bring to a low simmer over medium-high heat:

- Roasted wings and aromatics
- 6 cups **turkey stock**, warmed
- **Parsley**

Reduce heat and simmer gently, skimming fat from surface occasionally and turning wings so both sides get a chance to be submerged, until liquid is flavorful, mahogany in color, and reduced by about one-third (about 30–40 minutes).

Strain and discard solids, rinse pot, and return broth back to pot, and bring to a simmer.

Add and whisk constantly until completely incorporated:

- Beurre manié

Simmer, whisking often and skimming any foam from surface, until gravy is thick enough to coat a spoon (about 6–8 minutes).

Refrigerate.

## Thursday

### Turkey glaze

Cook in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and glaze thickens slightly (it should just barely coat a spoon, about 10-12 minutes).

- Small handful of hardy herbs (such as sage, rosemary, bay leaves, and/or thyme)
- 4 cloves **garlic**, crushed
- 2 2x1" strips **orange** zest
- 80 grams (~1/3 cup) **soy sauce**
- 80 grams (~1/3 cup) **red wine vinegar**
- 70 grams (~1/3 cup) **brown sugar**

Remove glaze from heat.

### Roast turkey

Rest turkey at room temperature for 2 hours.

Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425 F.

Rub turkey:

- 6 tablespoons **canola oil**

Pour into baking sheet:

- 1 cup **water**

Roast turkey, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until skin is mostly golden brown (about 20-25 minutes).

Reduce oven temperature to 300 F and continue to roast turkey, brushing with glaze every 20 minutes and adding more water as needed to maintain liquid in baking sheet, until the breast registers 150 F, and the thighs register 170 F, 50-70 minutes longer.

Tent with foil and rest 30-60 minutes before carving.

### Gravy

Return to a gentle simmer:

- **Gravy**

Remove from heat and whisk in:

- 2 teaspoons **sherry vinegar** or **red wine vinegar**
- 1 teaspoons **MSG**

Season to taste:

- **Kosher salt**
- **Black pepper**

Drink with turkey and mashed potatoes.
