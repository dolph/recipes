### Beurre manié

Mash together in a small bowl with fingers or a fork until homogenous:

- 55 grams **flour**
- 56 grams (4 tablespoons) **butter**, room temperature

Set aside.

### Gravy

Preheat oven to 450 F.

Toss wings, backbone, and neck in a 15" skillet with oil until coated.

- 3 pounds reserved turkey parts (no organs), broken down into 1" pieces
- 2 tablespoons **olive oil**

Roast, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and starting to crisp (about 25–35 minutes).

Remove wings from oven and add, tossing to coat with oil:

- 2 heads of **garlic**, cut in half crosswise
- 2 large **shallots**, unpeeled, halved
- 4" piece **ginger**, scrubbed, thickly sliced
- 4 ounces **baby bella, shiitake, or white button mushrooms**, torn into large pieces
- 8 grams **black peppercorns**, lightly crushed
- 60 grams **olive oil**

Return to oven and roast, tossing halfway through, until poultry is deeply browned and crisp and vegetables are browned (about 30–40 minutes).

Remove skillet from oven. Transfer solids to a 7-quart stock pot.

Set skillet on stovetop over medium-high heat. Add sherry and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until sherry is almost completely reduced (about 2 minutes).

- 60 grams (0.5 cup) **amontillado sherry**

Transfer everything to a 7-quart stock pot, add stock and parsley, and bring to a low simmer over medium-high heat:

- Roasted turkey parts and aromatics
- Reserved organs
- 1.5 quarts **chicken stock**, warmed
- **Parsley**, including stems

Reduce heat and simmer gently, skimming fat from surface occasionally and turning wings so both sides get a chance to be submerged, until liquid is flavorful, mahogany in color, and reduced by about one-third (about 30–40 minutes).

Strain through a fat separator, discarding fat and solids, rinse pot, and return broth back to pot, and bring to a simmer.

Add and whisk constantly until completely incorporated:

- Beurre manié

Simmer, whisking often and skimming any foam from surface, until gravy is thick enough to coat a spoon (about 6–8 minutes).

Refrigerate.

### Roast potatoes

Preheat oven to 425 F. Place potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet or in a large baking dish and cover tightly with foil. Roast until very tender (about 80–95 minutes) and internal temperature reaches 210 F.

- 5 pounds **Yukon Gold potatoes**, scrubbed

### Garlic mixture

Meanwhile, place in a large saucepan:

- 336 grams (24 tablespoons) **butter**
- 1 large head of **garlic**, halved crosswise
- 6 sprigs **thyme**
- 10 grams **black peppercorns**, lightly crushed
- 30 grams **kosher salt**
- 1050 grams (5 cups) **whole milk**
- Zest of 1 large **lemon** (in large strips)

Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Immediately remove from heat, cover, and let sit at least 30 minutes.

### Mashed potatoes

When potatoes are done, remove skins while they are very hot (hold with a kitchen towel), add to a 4-quart soup pot, and mash immediately.

Return garlic mixture to a simmer, then strain into pot with potatoes, discarding solids.

Set potato mixture over medium heat and whisk until liquid is incorporated and potatoes are very smooth and bubbling. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

Cover and refrigerate.

### Mashed potatoes topping

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Pulse in a food processor until finely chopped (about 15 seconds):

- 5 cloves of **garlic**

Add and process in long pulses until coarse crumbs form (about 1 minute):

- 2 1/2"-thick slices **country-style bread**, torn into 1" pieces

Add to breadcrumb mixture, and pulse just once or twice to combine:

- 2.5 cups **kettle-style potato chips** (such as Cape Cod)

Heat in a large skillet over medium heat until foaming:

- 5 tablespoons **butter**

Add:

- Breadcrumb mixture
- **Kosher salt**
- Freshly ground **black pepper**

Cook, stirring, until mixture is coated in butter and fragrant, about 1 minute.

Transfer skillet to 350 F oven and bake, tossing every 5 minutes, until dark golden brown (about 15–20 minutes).

Meanwhile, combine in a small bowl:

- 4 sprigs **thyme**, leaves picked
- 1.25 teaspoon **hot smoked Spanish paprika**
- Zest of 1 large **lemon**, finely grated

Remove crumb mixture from oven and immediately toss in thyme mixture. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Let topping cool in pan.

Store with a tight lid and refrigerate.

### Turkey glaze

Cook in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and glaze thickens slightly (it should just barely coat a spoon, about 10-12 minutes).

- Small handful of hardy herbs (such as sage, rosemary, bay leaves, and/or thyme)
- 4 cloves **garlic**, crushed
- 2 2x1" strips **orange** zest
- 80 grams (~1/3 cup) **soy sauce**
