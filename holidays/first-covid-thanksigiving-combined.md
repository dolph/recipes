### Roast gravy parts

Preheat oven to 450 F.

Toss wings in a large roasting tray with oil until coated.

- 6 pounds **turkey and/or chicken wings**, flats and drumettes separated
- 4 tablespoons **olive oil**

Roast, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and starting to crisp (about 25–35 minutes).

Remove wings from oven and add, tossing to coat with oil:

- 4 heads of **garlic**, cut in half crosswise
- 4 large **shallots**, unpeeled, halved
- 2 4" piece **ginger**, scrubbed, thickly sliced
- 8 ounces **crimini, shiitake, or white button mushrooms**, torn into large pieces
- 16 grams **black peppercorns**, lightly crushed

Return to oven and roast, tossing halfway through, until wings are deeply browned and crisp and vegetables are browned (about 30–40 minutes).

Remove skillet from oven and set on stovetop over medium-high heat. Add sherry and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until sherry is almost completely reduced (about 2 minutes).

### Gravy

Transfer everything to a dutch oven, add stock and parsley, and bring to a low simmer over medium-high heat:

- Roasted wings and aromatics
- 3 quarts **turkey stock**, warmed
- **Parsley**

Reduce heat and simmer gently, skimming fat from surface occasionally and turning wings so both sides get a chance to be submerged, until liquid is flavorful, mahogany in color, and reduced by about one-third (about 30–40 minutes).

Strain through a fat separator, discarding fat and solids, rinse pot, and return broth back to pot, and bring to a simmer.

Add and whisk constantly until completely incorporated:

- Beurre manié

Simmer, whisking often and skimming any foam from surface, until gravy is thick enough to coat a spoon (about 6–8 minutes).

Refrigerate.

## Roast potatoes

Preheat oven to 425 F. Place potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet or in a large baking dish and cover tightly with foil. Roast until very tender (about 80–95 minutes) and internal temperature reaches 210 F.

### Garlic mixture

Meanwhile, place in a large saucepan:

- 350 grams (25 tablespoons) **butter**
- 1 head of **garlic**, halved crosswise

- 10 grams **black peppercorns**, lightly crushed
- 30 grams **kosher salt**
- 1050 grams (5 cups) **whole milk**
- Zest of 1 large **lemon** (in large strips)

Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Immediately remove from heat, cover, and let sit at least 30 minutes.

### Mashed potatoes

When potatoes are done, remove skins while they are very hot (hold with a kitchen towel), add to a 4-quart soup pot, and mash immediately.

Return garlic mixture to a simmer, then strain into pot with potatoes, discarding solids.

Set potato mixture over medium heat and whisk until liquid is incorporated and potatoes are very smooth and bubbling. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

Cover and refrigerate.

## Mashed potatoes topping

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Pulse in a food processor until finely chopped (about 15 seconds):

- 5 cloves of **garlic**

Add and process in long pulses until coarse crumbs form (about 1 minute):

- 2 1/2"-thick slices **country-style bread**, torn into 1" pieces

Add to breadcrumb mixture, and pulse just once or twice to combine:

Cook, stirring, until mixture is coated in butter and fragrant, about 1 minute.

Meanwhile, combine in a small bowl:

- 4 sprigs **thyme**, leaves picked
- 1.25 teaspoon **hot smoked Spanish paprika**
- Zest of 1 large **lemon**, finely grated

Remove crumb mixture from oven and immediately toss in thyme mixture. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Let topping cool in pan.

### Turkey glaze

- 8 cloves **garlic**, crushed
- Zest of 1 small **orange**, in strips
- 160 grams (~1/3 cup) **soy sauce**

Rub turkey:

Pour into each baking sheet:

Roast turkey with the dark meat on the top rack, and the white meat on the bottom rack, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until skin is mostly golden brown (about 20-25 minutes).

Reduce oven temperature to 300 F and continue to roast turkey, brushing with glaze every 20 minutes and adding more water as needed to maintain liquid in baking sheet, until the breast registers 150 F, and the thighs register 170 F, 50-70 minutes longer.
