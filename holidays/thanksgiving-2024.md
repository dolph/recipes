## Tuesday

### Beurre manié

With gloved fingers (or a fork), mash together in a 24-ounce container until homogenous:

- 55 grams **flour**
- 56 grams (4 tablespoons) **butter**, room temperature

Set aside for gravy.

### Rub mixture

Combine in a medium bowl:

- 1 cup **mayonnaise**
- 1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon **kosher salt**
- 1/4 cup whole **black peppercorns**, very finely ground
- 1/4 cup whole **pink peppercorns**, very finely ground
- 1/4 cup **garlic powder**
- 1/4 cup **onion powder**
- 2 tablespoon **smoked paprika**
- 1 tablespoon **anchovy paste**

Set aside.

### Prep turkey

Set aside turkey neck, giblets, wing tips, and organs.

Dry the turkey thoroughly with paper towels.

Rub the turkeys thoroughly with the rub mixture, making sure to get it into all the nooks and crannies. Truss the turkey and refrigerate.

### Gravy

Preheat oven to 450 F.

Place reserved turkey parts and chicken wings into a large roasting pan, and toss with oil until coated:

- Reserved turkey parts (no organs), broken down into 1" pieces
- 4 pounds **chicken wings**
- 2 tablespoons **olive oil**

Roast, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and starting to crisp (about 25–35 minutes). Add, tossing to coat with oil:

- 4 heads of **garlic**, cut in half crosswise
- 4 large **shallots**, unpeeled, halved
- 8" piece **ginger**, scrubbed, thickly sliced
- 16 ounces **baby bella, shiitake, or white button mushrooms**, torn into large pieces
- 16 grams **black peppercorns**, lightly crushed
- 120 grams **olive oil**

Return to oven and roast, tossing halfway through, until poultry is deeply browned and crisp and vegetables are browned (about 30–40 minutes).

Remove roasting pan from oven. Transfer solids to a 12-quart stock pot.

Set roasting pan onto griddle over medium-high heat. Add sherry and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until sherry is almost completely reduced (about 2 minutes).

- 120 grams (1 cup) **amontillado sherry**

Transfer everything to the stock pot, and bring to a low simmer over medium-high heat:

- Roasted poultry and aromatics
- Reserved organs
- 2 bunches **parsley**, including stems
- 3 quarts water

Reduce heat and simmer gently, skimming fat from surface occasionally, until liquid is flavorful, mahogany in color, and reduced by about one-third (at least an hour).

Strain through a fat separator, discarding fat and solids, rinse pot, and return stock back to pot, and bring to a simmer.

Add and whisk constantly until completely incorporated:

- Beurre manié

Simmer, whisking often and skimming any foam from surface, until gravy is thick enough to coat a spoon (about 6–8 minutes).

Refrigerate.

## Wednesday

### Prep potatoes

Soak in a large container and store overnight in the refrigerator, ensuring potatoes are fully submerged with a plate:

- 8 pounds **Russet potatoes**, peeled, and cut into 1" pieces
- Cold water

### Garlic mixture

Meanwhile, place in a large saucepan or 8 quart stock pot:

- 537 grams (38 tablespoons) **butter**
- 2 large head of **garlic**, halved crosswise
- 10 sprigs **thyme**
- 16 grams **black peppercorns**, lightly crushed
- 48 grams **kosher salt**
- 1/2 gallon **whole milk**
- Zest of 2 large **lemon** (in large strips)

Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Immediately remove from heat, cover, and let sit at least 30 minutes.

Cover and refrigerate.

### Mashed potatoes topping

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Pulse in a food processor until finely chopped (about 15 seconds):

- 5 cloves of **garlic**

Add and process in long pulses until coarse crumbs form (about 1 minute):

- 2 1/2"-thick slices **country-style bread**, torn into 1" pieces

Add to breadcrumb mixture, and pulse just once or twice to combine:

- 2.5 cups **kettle-style potato chips** (such as Cape Cod)

Heat in a large skillet over medium heat until foaming:

- 5 tablespoons **butter**

Add:

- Breadcrumb mixture
- **Kosher salt**
- Freshly ground **black pepper**

Cook, stirring, until mixture is coated in butter and fragrant, about 1 minute.

Transfer skillet to 350 F oven and bake, tossing every 5 minutes, until dark golden brown (about 15–20 minutes).

Meanwhile, combine in a small bowl:

- 4 sprigs **thyme**, leaves picked
- 1.25 teaspoon **hot smoked Spanish paprika**
- Zest of 1 large **lemon**, finely grated

Remove crumb mixture from oven and immediately toss in thyme mixture. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Let topping cool in pan.

Transfer to a 12-ounce container and refrigerate.

### Turkey glaze

Cook in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and glaze thickens slightly (it should just barely coat a spoon, about 10-12 minutes).

- Small handful of hardy herbs (such as sage, rosemary, bay leaves, and/or thyme)
- 4 cloves **garlic**, crushed
- 2 2x1" strips **orange** zest
- 80 grams (~1/3 cup) **soy sauce**
- 80 grams (~1/3 cup) **red wine vinegar**
- 70 grams (~1/3 cup) **brown sugar**

Remove glaze from heat, discard solids, and refrigerate.

## Thursday

### Mashed potatoes

Discard liquid and rinse potatoes under cold water until water runs clear.

When potatoes are done, remove skins while they are very hot (hold with a kitchen towel), add to a stand mixer bowl, and whisk immediately.

Return garlic mixture to a simmer, then strain into stand mixer with potatoes, discarding solids, and whisking to combine thoroughly.

Return potato mixture to medium heat and whisk manually until liquid is fully incorporated and potatoes are very smooth and bubbling. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

> TODO: Transfer to a 13x9" baking dish, cover, and refrigerate.


### Prep

#### Flavor enhancing slurry

Whisk together in a small bowl and set aside:

- 2 teaspoons **sherry vinegar** or **red wine vinegar**
- 1 teaspoon **MSG**

#### Minced parsley

- 1/3 cup minced **parsley**

### Roast turkey

**T-4.5h**: Rest turkey at room temperature for 2 hours.

**T-2.5h**: Place two racks distributed in middle of oven, with enough room for the breasts to fit on the bottom rack; preheat to 425 F.

Rub turkey:

- 6 tablespoons **canola oil**

Pour into each baking sheet:

- 1 cup **water**

Roast turkey with the dark meat on the top rack, and the white meat on the bottom rack, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until skin is mostly golden brown (about 20-25 minutes).

**T-2h**: Reduce oven temperature to 300 F and continue to roast turkey, brushing with glaze every 20 minutes and adding more water as needed to maintain liquid in baking sheet, until the breast registers 150 F, and the thighs register 170 F, 50-70 minutes longer.

- Turkey glaze, warmed

**T-1.5h**: Tent with foil and rest 30-60 minutes before carving.

Reserve drippings for gravy.

### Finish stuffing

In a large bowl, combine cornbread, sausage, and vegetable mixture.

In a medium bowl, whisk together until very well combined:

- 3 **eggs**
- 3.5 cups **low sodium chicken broth**

Pour liquid mixture over cornbread mixture and let sit, gently stirring every minute or so, until cornbread has absorbed all or virtually all of the liquid. Season:

- 1.5 teaspoons **kosher salt**
- **Black pepper**

Lightly grease a 3-quart or 13x9 baking dish. Transfer stuffing to dish and tap dish lightly against counter to distribute and compact stuffing.

Cover tightly with foil and bake until stuffing is very hot throughout and bubbles appear around sides (40–45 minutes).

Remove foil, and move to highest rack in the oven until top is lightly browned (15-20 minutes). A 425 F oven or quick broil at the end will speed the process.

### Finish mashed potatoes

**T-1.5h**: Reheat over medium, whisking constantly and loosening with more milk if needed:

- Mashed potatoes
- **Milk**

Add:

- Minced parsley

Transfer mashed potatoes to a large bowl and sprinkle topping over.

- Mashed potatoes
- Mashed potatoes topping

### Finish gravy

**T-1.5h**: Return to a gentle simmer, cover, and hold until turkey comes out of the oven:

- **Gravy**

**T-1h**: Add and whisk to combine:

- Turkey drippings

Remove from heat and whisk in:

- Flavor enhancing slurry

Season to taste:

- **Kosher salt**
- **Black pepper**
