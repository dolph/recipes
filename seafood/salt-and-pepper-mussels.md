> Serves 2.

> The salt here comes entirely from the parmesean and the pasta water. Be heavy handed with both!

Start the pasta:

- 3 quarts water
- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 160 grams thin pasta, such as capellini

Meanwhile, gently sauté until evenly browned, tossing occassionally:

- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 6 cloves garlic, crushed

When the garlic is browned, remove from heat, set aside and cover. Allow to sit for 10 minutes. It should have the flavor of roasted garlic when ready.

Remove the garlic from the pan and set aside.

When the pasta is al dente, set aside at least 1/2 cup of pasta water and strain the pasta.

Return the sauté pan to a medium-low heat and bring to a simmer:

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup pasta water (reserve extra in case you need to maintain moisture later)

Add, cover, and return heat to low for 8 minutes:

- 1 pound mussels, brushed

Add to pan and toss to finish:

- Cooked pasta
- Pan-roasted garlic
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tablespoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil

Garnish with:

- Freshly grated parmesean
- Fresh parsley, chopped

Serve with:

- Sauvignon blanc
- Friends
