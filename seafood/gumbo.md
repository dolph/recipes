In a Dutch oven, over medium-high heat, cook until well browned, about 8 minutes:

- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 pound smoked sausage, such as andouille or kielbasa, cut crosswise 1/2-inch thick pieces

Remove the sausage with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Set aside.

Season the chicken with the Essence and add in batches to the fat remaining in the pan. Cook over medium-high heat until well browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan, let cool, and then refrigerate until ready to use.

- 4 pounds chicken thighs, skin removed
- 1 tablespoon Essence or Creole seasoning

Combine the remaining 1/2 cup oil and the flour in the same Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook, stirring slowly and constantly for 20 to 25 minutes, to make a dark brown roux, the color of chocolate.

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup canola oil

Add the onions, celery, and bell peppers and cook, stirring, until wilted, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the reserved sausage, salt, cayenne, and bay leaves, stir, and cook for 2 minutes.

- 2 cups chopped onions
- 1 cup chopped celery
- 1 cup chopped bell peppers
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
- 3 bay leaves

Stirring, slowly add the chicken stock, and cook, stirring, until well combined. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.

- 9 cups chicken stock or canned low-sodium chicken broth

Add the reserved chicken to the pot and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, skimming off any fat that rises to the surface.
Remove the pot from the heat.

Using a slotted spoon, remove the chicken thighs from the gumbo and place on a cutting board to cool slightly. Remove and discard the bay leaves.

Pull the chicken meat from the bones and shred, discarding the bones and skin.

Return the meat to the gumbo and stir in the green onions, parsley, and file powder.

- 1/2 cup chopped green onions
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves
- 1 tablespoon file powder

Spoon rice into the bottom of deep bowls or large cups and ladle the gumbo on top.

- White Rice

Serve with:

- Hot sauce
