Rinse shells thoroughly.

Season the shrimp:

Refrigerate peeled shrimp.

Combine in a heavy 6-quart stockpot, and bring to a boil over high heat. Skim

Remove the stock from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a
clean container; let cool completely.

Add the flour and stir continuously to make a roux. Stir the roux over medium

often, for 10 minutes.

45 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook rice:
