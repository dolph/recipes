Clam & scallop stew

Bring to a boil in a large pot, cover, and reduce heat to low until mussels open, shaking often (~5 minutes):

- 2 pounds mussels, scrubbed debearded
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2/3 cup dry white wine

- 2 parsley sprigs
- 3 large thyme sprigs
- 2 bay leaves

Discard parsley sprigs, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves.

Add, and simmer until opaque in the center (~4 minutes):

- 12 ounces sea scallops

Reduce heat to low. Add:

- Cooked mussels

In a small bowl, whisk together, temper with hot broth, slowly add to pot, and allow to thicken:

- 2/3 cup crème fraîche
- 2 large egg yolks

Stir in:

- 1/3 cup chopped parsley.

Season:

- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper.
