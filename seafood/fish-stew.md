Fish stew
=========

> This is basically a simplified Cioppino.

> Serves 4.

Saute in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until onions begin to brown:

- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 2 large **onions**, chopped fine
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Add, and cook until onions are soft:

- 4 **garlic cloves**, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Bring to a simmer, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes:

- 1/4 cup water
- 1 (28 ounce) can **whole peeled tomatoes**, drained with juice reserved, chopped coarse
- 1 (8 ounce) bottle **clam juice**
- 1 cup dry **white wine**
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano

Submerge in broth, and gently simmer until fish is cooked through (~12 minutes):

- 2 pounds **red snapper** (or any firm white fish), skin removed, cut into 8 pieces

Transfer fish to a plate to avoid overcooking it.

Stir into the broth and season to taste

- 1/4 cup chopped **parsley**
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

Serve each portion in soup bowls with two pieces of fish, and garnish:

- Olive oil
- Parsley
