# Sushi rice

Rinse until the water runs clear:

- 1 cup **sushi rice**

Place the rice and water into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil:

- 1 cup **water**

Once it begins to boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and cover.

Cook for 15 minutes.

Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine in a small sauce pan over medium heat, until sugar is dissolved, and immediately remove from heat:

- 1 piece of **konbu**, about 2 inch x 2 inch square
- 2 tablespoons **sugar**
- 4 tablespoons **rice vinegar**
- 1 teaspoon **kosher salt**

Transfer the seasoned vinegar into a small bowl to allow it to cool.

Spread the rice evenly into a casserole dish and add most of the vinegar mixture.

Fan the rice while gently folding to combine, seasoning to taste with remaining vinegar mixture.

Hold at room temperature with a piece of plastic wrap pressed against the surface until served.
