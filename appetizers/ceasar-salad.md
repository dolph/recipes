Caesar Salad
============

> Makes 6 servings.

Dressing
--------

Chop together:

- 6 anchovy fillets packed in oil, drained
- 1 small garlic clove
- Kosher salt

Use the side of a knife blade to mash into a paste, then scrape into a medium bowl.

Whisk in:

- 2 large egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard

Adding drop by drop to start, gradually whisk in olive oil, then vegetable oil; whisk until dressing is thick and glossy.

> Maybe cut the amount of vegetable oil down? The dressing has a pretty intense flavor without it, and it seems to be diluted the more veggie oil you add. Taste at about 1/4 cup?

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil

Whisk in:

- 3 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan

Season with:

- Kosher salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Lemon juice, to taste

Set dressing aside (refridgerate up to one day ahead).

Croutons
--------

Preheat oven to 375 F. Toss bread with olive oil on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.

- 3 cups torn 1" pieces country bread, with crusts
- 3 tablespoons olive oil

Season with:

- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

Bake, tossing occasionally, until golden (~15 minutes).
