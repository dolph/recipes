## Cake

Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 325 F. Using your fingertips, grease bottom and sides of a 9" round cake pan with vegetable oil. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper, smoothing to eliminate air bubbles. (It may sound fancy, but making a parchment circle is easy! Place pan on a piece of parchment, trace circumference with a pencil, then cut it out.)

- **Canola oil**

Whisk together in a large bowl:

- 160 grams **AP flour**
- 250 grams **sugar**
- 7 grams **baking powder**
- 1/4 teaspoon **baking soda**
- 1.25 teaspoons **kosher salt**

Add, and whisk to combine:

- 1/2 cup (59 grams?) unsweetened **cocoa powder**, sifted

Whisk together in a medium bowl until well combined and creamy, about 30 seconds.

- 2 large **eggs**
- 3/4 cup (161 grams?) **canola oil**
- 1 teaspoon **vanilla extract**

Using a spatula, mix egg mixture into dry ingredients until fully incorporated, thick, and pasty.

Warm in a small saucepan over medium heat until it comes to just a bare simmer (do not boil).

- 242 grams (~1 cup) **milk**

Whisk warmed milk into batter until lump-free and just combined (do not overmix).

Immediately transfer batter to prepared pan. Tap pan on work surface to release bubbles.

Bake cake, turning pan halfway through, until a toothpick comes out clean (40–50 minutes).

Transfer to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan.

## Frosting

Combine with a spaturla in a medium bowl over a double boiler until chocolate is melted and mixture is homogeneous and thick:

- 4 ounces **semisweet chocolate** (do not exceed 64% cacao)
- 115 grams (~1/2 cup) **heavy cream**

Chill ganache until cool to the touch (~25 minutes).

Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, whisk in a large bowl until very smooth and no lumps remain:

- 116 grams (~4 ounces) **cream cheese**, room temperature
- 47 grams (~1/4 cup) **powdered sugar**
- 3/4 teaspoon **vanilla extract**
- 1/4 teaspoon **kosher salt**

Beat in cooled chocolate ganache on medium speed, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until frosting just holds its peak and is well-combined and a little thicker (~1 minute). You don’t want to overbeat because the frosting can become too stiff.

Run a butter knife around edges of pan. Invert cooled cake onto a plate and peel off parchment. Invert again onto a platter.

Top cake with frosting, spreading evenly across the surface. Make some decorative swooshes with a spoon, if desired. Slice and serve.
