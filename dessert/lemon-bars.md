Lemon bars
==========

> Makes about 9 servings.

Preheat oven to 325 F.

Crust
-----

Line a 9x9 baking pan with enough parchment paper to overhang two sides.

In a food processor, pulse together to combine:

- 155 grams **AP flour**
- 50 grams **sugar**
- 25 grams **powdered sugar**
- 1 teaspoon grated **lemon zest**
- 1/4 teaspoon **fine sea salt**

Add, and pulse to make a crumbly dough:

- 10 tablespoons cold **unsalted butter**, cut into cubes

Press dough into prepared pan, as thinly as possible (discarding any extra dough).

Bake until crust is pale golden (~35 minutes).

Curd
----

In a small sauce pan, whisk together over medium heat, bring to a boil for no more than 30 seconds (until thickened):

- 3/4 cup **lemon juice**
- 150 grams **sugar**
- 2 large **eggs** plus 3 yolks
- 5 grams (~1.5 teaspoons) **cornstarch**
- 1/4 teaspoon **fine sea salt**

Remove from heat immediately.

Whisk in:

- 1/2 tablespoon **lemon zest**
- 4 tablespoons **butter**
- 60 grams **olive oil**

Pour curd over crust, spread evenly, and bake until set (~12-15 minutes longer).

Cool to room temp over a wire rack, and chill in the fridge until cold.

Remove bars from pan to slice, and garnish:

- **Finishing salt** (sprinkle very lightly and very evenly)
- Powdered sugar
