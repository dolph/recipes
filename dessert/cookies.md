- 6 ounces (1 cup) semi-sweet chocolate chips

Use a pair of spoons to portion out 25 grams at a time, form into rounds, and spread onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

Add a few flakes of finishing salt to each round.

Bake until golden brown (about 11 minutes). Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.
