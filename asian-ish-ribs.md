Asian-ish ribs

> Smoking the ribs is optional, but then you should start the braise at 200 F for two hours before raising the temperature to 250 F, include a tablespoon of liquid smoke in the braising liquid, and finish them under the broiler to char them a bit.

Smoke the ribs for 2 hours at 275 F.
