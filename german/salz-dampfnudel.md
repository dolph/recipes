# Salz-Dampfnudel

> Serves 3-6

Form a dough by mixing:

- 3 cups **flour**
- 2.25 teaspoon **instant yeast**
- 1 teaspoon **kosher salt**

Add:

- 3/4 cup **whole milk**, warmed to 105 F
- 3 tablespoons **pork lard** (or **butter**), melted
- 1 **egg**

Knead until smooth and elastic (8-10 minutes).

Cover and let rise until doubled (60-90 minutes). The dough should be soft and supple.

Divide the dough into 6 equal balls, shape tightly, seam-side down, and rest covered for 20 minutes.

In a wide, heavy pan with a tight lid, add:

- 1/2 cup **whole milk**
- 3 tablespoons **pork lard** (or **butter**)
- 1/2 teaspoon **kosher salt**

Arrange the dough balls with space between, cover **tightly** and cook over medium-low heat for 20 minutes. Do not open the lid until you hear gentle sizzling and no liquid remains - the bottoms should be lightly caramelized and golden.

Optionally, add additional **pork lard** (or **butter**) and flip the dampfnudel for a double-sided finish.
