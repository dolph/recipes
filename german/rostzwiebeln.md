# Röstzwiebeln

Heat 1/2 inch oil in a wide pan to 325–340 F, and fry in batches until lightly golden (6-8 minutes):

- 6–8 large **shallots**, sliced paper thin
- **Neutral oil**, enough for shallow frying

Drain and season on a wire rack or paper towels. Season immediately:

- **Fine salt**
- **White pepper** (optional)

Serve immediately.
