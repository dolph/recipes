# Schnitzel

Pound cutlets to ~1/8 inch in a zip-top bag, and lightly season:

- 4 thin-cut **pork loin chops** (or **veal cutlets**)
- **Kosher salt**

Apply breading in three steps. Step one:

- **White pepper** (or **black pepper**)
- **Flour**

Step two:

- 2 **eggs**, beaten

Step three:

- **Fine breadcrumbs** (or **panko**, crushed finer)

Fry schnitzel one at a time, shaking the pan so the crust "waves":

- **Neutral oil**
- 2 tablespoons **butter**

Serve with:

- **Lemon** wedges
